## Sandplay Therapy

As an observer of **Sandplay Therapy**, it may appear that your child is simply playing in sand.  This is not so.  The sandtray becomes a setting for people to gain a different or new perspective on a situation.

The act of playing in the sand allows the child to ‘sort out’ and make sense of experiences and information. By creating  a scene using symbols (small figurines, toys, ornaments, shells, rocks etc), a child can regain a sense of strength or hope.  The feelings related to the death of a pet or someone close can be expressed in a sandplay.  Bullying is another common theme in the sandtray.

Children are often asked to explain behaviour or verbalise how they feel. This may be difficult for the child. They may not know why they behaved in a certain way or how they feel. Symbols provide a means for expression and exploration in a non-verbal form.

Children can unconsciously process an issue by representing it in this way. Allowing free creation, and working with the ‘story’ can help modify acting-out behaviour. For example, anxieties about school, once expressed through sandplay, may be reduced or even resolved.  Generally children will create a sandtray without direction or a theme.

Sometimes, a child will ask to take home a photo of a creation they have made. If your child does this please remember that the child is the person who makes the meaning --- for example, a monster may represent feeling powerful for the child, and if an adult labels it as scary or horrible, it can be counter-productive. It is helpful to ask the child to tell you something about it and to refrain from your own opinions and comments. A good start could be: “Would you like to share anything about your sandtray?” Your child may not wish to share at all and parents are encouraged to accept this too."
