## Details

**Values:** I aim to work with children in a way that helps them to find their own skills to deal with problems and hard times.  I honour different family structures and practices without judgement.

**Contact and Communication:** I really value your input.  If you notice any changes in your child --- welcome or unwelcome --- please email me with an update or a request for a phone call.

One of the benefits of working closely with the school is that I can easily talk with school wellbeing and teaching staff.  This is a good way to receive detailed feedback and set up supports for your child.  However, if you prefer for this not to happen, please indicate your preference on the consent form."

"**First sessions:** One of the primary tasks in counselling is to develop unconditional positive regard --- a trusting, open and respectful relationship.  I also try to understand the childâ€™s world from their perspective.  Often the first session or two will be spent exploring these aims.

**Length of support:** I aim to work at the speed that suits your child. Sometimes children only need one group of 5 sessions, but other children may need more.  I also offer a follow-up service for children who have completed at least one group of 5 sessions and would like to occasionally see me to check in.
