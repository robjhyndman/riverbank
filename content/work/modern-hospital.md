**Narrative Therapy** is interested in how we create our stories of life.  These are not stories that are ‘made up’, but stories that are based on real life events.  Sometimes people, including children, can get fenced into a particular story line that doesn’t suit them.  Narrative therapists structure conversations in particular ways that help people to notice storylines, talk about their values and intentions for life, and ‘rewrite’ story lines that are not helping them.  Narrative Therapy is interested in the existing skills and knowledge of people, how they have helped them in the past and how they could help them in the future.

I may send home letters, documents or art works that are based on conversations I have with your child.  I will talk carefully with your child as to how they want to share these letters.  They are not a statement of ‘truth’ or a report to give to a doctor, but are a record of an evolving story.

Sometimes these letters may ask for a response.  It is important that these responses are based on your experience of real events.  If you are unsure about how to respond, I am happy to talk with you --- just send me an email.

I have recently completed my Masters degree in Narrative Therapy and Community Work at Melbourne University.
