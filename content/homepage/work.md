Riverbank Counselling provides low cost individual and group counselling for students at Lilydale West Primary School.

We aim to work with children in a way that helps them to find their own skills to deal with problems and hard times. I honour different family structures and practices without judgement.

Our principal consultant is **Leanne Hyndman**, who has a Bachelor of Arts in Counselling from Tabor College and a Masters of Narrative Therapy & Community Work from the University of Melbourne.

Leanne is particularly trained in Narrative Therapy and Sandplay, both well-suited to children.
